Chess Score vs Time of Day:

How does my energy level affect my chess? Chess is a game that requires a lot of thinking and speed, so I hypothesized that my chess abilities will decrease as the day progressed. In order to measure my chess
abilities, I used average chess score, which is defined as (number of wins+0.5*number of draws)/(number of games). Average chess score is always between 0 and 1. The number of games you win is proportional to your 
score.

To give some needed background on chess, there are many different types of chess based on what time control you play at. In this project, 'bullet chess' refers to chess where each player has excatly 1 minute to
play all their moves. 'Blitz chess' is chess where each player has 3 minutes and a 2-second increment per move. In bullet chess, it's pretty much all about how fast you are at making moves and also getting out of 
the opening stage without a serious disadvantage. Blitz chess has more thinking, but speed is still a significant component. Bullet chess is extremely addictive; it's a lot of fun when you checkmate someone within
a minute of starting the game! I pretty much only played bullet and blitz games this year (and much more bullet than blitz), so that's what I focused on.

First, I separated the day to morning (7-12), afternoon (12-17), evening (17-21), and night (21-7). Next, I needed to figure out how I could get data on my chess games. I play chess (mostly) on Lichess, 
which has excellent open data including result and when the game was played, which was exactly what I needed. Since the data is entered by computer, I had to do very little cleaning (yay!). 

Second, I got rid of unnecessary data and created the attributes that I needed: game id (unique to the game), speed (bullet or blitz), month, day, time (morning, afternoon...), colour (white or black), and result
(1 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for lose). You can find all this on my python code document.

Third, I uploaded the data to Tableau to create visualizations to test my hypothesis. You can find the finished product here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jared.gobin/viz/AverageChessScorevsTimeofDay/ChessScorevsTimeofDay?publish=yes 
I created a bar chart that plots average chess score vs time of day, a line chart that plots average score vs month to see how 
my score changed over time, and a pie chart to compare number of games played in each month.

The bar chart confirmed my hypothesis: I played well in the morning, decent in the afternoon, poor in the evening, but slightly better at nightimmediately popped out is that I did the best in February, and worst 
in August. In February, I got hearing damage and tinnitus. I was not sleeping very much, so I figured I would have a terrible result. August's result was expected, as I was finishing up my master's thesis and my
mind was pre-occupied. I played the most games in October, when I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life now that I no longer wanted to go into academia. 

Probably my favourite insight from this graphic is that I play well at night as black! There are really just two months dragging the average down; I played very well in the other months! (To see this, click on
'night' and 'black' options. When playing as black, you are usually defending and counter-punching, rather than being the aggressor. And at night, I figured my intuitions for those counter-punches would be poorer!

In conclusion: my chess level decreases as the day goes on, but there are some interesting exceptions to the rule, such as when I am playing as black at night.

Limitations: this is just 1 year's data, and I did not play nearly as much blitz as I'd like to. My new year's resolution is to play greater time formats more frequently and to redo this analysis in a year.
